# TIC TAC TOE TWO

This project is a tic tac toe game with a "gobblet version" like gameplay called tic tac toe two!

Its a study project that includes a client made with Raylib/C++ and an API based backend made with node.js to enable multiplayer.

This is my first game project made from zero without following any tuturials and with no engine! So please any feedback is wellcomed.

## How to run this project

To run this project you have to have vscode and raylib installed on your machine at the same configure path included in the config files at .vscode folder.

To learn how to have this ready you can follow this [video tuturial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaAcVk5jUd8) from Programming With Nick youtube channel.
